// What this site calls things.
//
// Everything here is a value rather than a rule. The compute functions in
// records-core.js and h2h-core.js work out what happened; this decides how it
// is said. Splitting them is what lets the same computation serve a baseball
// site and a football one — the Packers repo has a file of this shape and a
// different set of answers, and the diff between the two is the whole list of
// what a shared core has to be told rather than assume.
//
// Pure data, no imports. It has to be readable from the browser, from the
// server and from a test without dragging anything with it.
//
// Three kinds of thing live here, and they are different:
//
//   nouns    what to call the team, the sport's units, its championship
//   rules    where two sports genuinely disagree about what counts
//   copy     lines a template gets wrong, kept as words rather than derived
//
// The third is the largest section here, and larger than the football site's,
// which is itself the point. Baseball has more records that have never
// happened, and "The Brewers have never thrown a no-hitter" is a sentence no
// template would produce and no other sport would want.
